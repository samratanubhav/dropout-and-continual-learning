# dropout-and-continual-learning
Dropout, its not just a heck/tool for regularization but also a very important tool which can be used for many other purposes in machine learning. Although it has been extensively researched now but recently
in a research work it was found that it works really well for to counter the catastrophic forgetting problem of continual learning.<br>
Dropout works like state of the art solution for this problem. Studied, implemented and experimented various aspects of it.
